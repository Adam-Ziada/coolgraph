#' coolgraph. making complex graphs easy
#'
#'
#'This package has been inspired by my research group and there desire to make awesome graphs without really knowing much about R. In this package I will be introducing three new funcitons, one that allows you to make a simple heatmap, another that lets you copare 2 continous variables and facet over anothe 2 categorical variables, and a 3rd that allows you to compare 3 continous variables by mapping the 3rd variable to the size of the data points. It contains 3 major functions, heatmap(), facet2D(), and scalesize(). Note that facet2D() is currently not working, although we are working to fix it.
